	<div class="block block-strong"><p>Avoiding eye contact can detect if someone is worried and their eyes will shift around the room. 
		This usually happens when someone is becoming too stressed and will naturally try to find 
		a way to find a solution to the situation. One also might tend to blink a lot when they are lying.</p>
	<p>However, there can be other factors to why someone is avoiding eye contact. They may 
		shift their eyes side to side when they think to gather their thoughts. Or they 
		may be uncomfortable or nervous because of the situation they are in or who is around them.</p>
		<p>Does the subject avoid eye contact when answering questions?
Some say the eyes are the windows to the soul: if you believe this, then attempting to hide your eyes would be similar to “protecting” your soul from being looked at whenever you tell a lie 
Subjects who overly avoid eye contact are likely trying to hide something (or they are very nervous).
<p>Things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shifting eyes</li>
<li>Pupil size </li></ul>

	<div class="block block-strong"><p>Body language can tell a lot about a person, whether it be their posture, where they are 
	    facing, their breathing, or if they fidget a lot. Usually when someone is lying they 
	    tend to guard themselves by crossing their arms or legs, or place something in between 
	    themselves and the person asking the question. They could be knowingly or unknowingly facing 
	    the door as a sign that they want to get out of the situation. Other physiological tells 
	    like rapid breathing, redness of the face, or sweating can be signs of nervousness. One should also 
	    pay attention to any small signs of twitching or change in pupil size.
		</p>
<b>Posture</b>
<p>Is the subject slouched over? Crossing arms and/or legs?  
This is referred to as “closed” body language. 
People will do these things to try and “cover” themselves. They are protecting vital spots and trying to “hide” themselves, and the truth, from the person questioning them.</p>

<b>Breathing</b>
<p>In tense situations: is the subject’s breathing normal?
In calm situations: is the subject’s breathing heightened or irregular? 
Pay attention to your subject’s breathing pattern, as it can be a good way to determine their level of anxiety, nervousness, or lack thereof. </p>

<b> Fidgeting/Twitching</b>
<p>Is the subject playing with their hair, skin, fingers, etc.?  Do they seem uncomfortable?  Constantly moving (slight or large movements)?
When someone is nervous, they will tend to find some way to preoccupy their body, sometimes it’s a conscious effort (fidgeting), other times it isn’t (twitching).  These can also be referred to as “grooming gestures”.
Be sure to analyze your subject’s movement.</p>

<b>Sweating/Redness to the face</b>
<p>
Does your subject sweat when the room isn’t even hot?
Does your subject have an unnaturally red/flush face?
Both of these can reflect a rise in internal body temperature, which can reflect nervousness.</p>
 
<b>Physiological responses </b>
<p>When people are under stress or are nervous, there are some common physiological responses that their body exhibits:</p>
<ul>
<li> Dry mouth </li>
<li>  Sweating</li>
<li> Gastrointestinal distress (farting, burping, stomach growling, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<b>Alligator tears</b>
<p>This is basically “fake crying”; a person making the motions and sounds of crying, yet no actual tears are being shed. 
A rare sight to see, but if you do, it is a strong indication of lying. </p>

		  <div class="block-title">Verbal Language</div>
	<div class="block block-strong"><p>There are different voice patterns that can be detected when someone is lying like speech 
		hesitations, pitch, or rate of their speech. Speech hesitations consist of the use of 
		"uh", "um" or other variations of filler words. 
		Compared to one's regular voice, when a person is lying they can tend to change their voice 
	    	pitch either be higher or lower than normal. Another thing to take in consideration while 
		listening to someone answer is how fast someone is talking. People tend to talk slower, 
	    	when they are lying in order to buy more time for them to think of the best lies for their 
	    	story to be more believable.</p>
			
		<b>Voice pattern</b>
<p>Pay attention to the subject’s vocal pitch and tone.
Does their voice fluctuate from how it normally sounds? 
This fluctuation is a good indicator for nervousness/anxiety/stress.</p>
 
<b>Random pitch change</b>
<p>When talking to someone, if their voice suddenly goes higher than normal when saying something, it is usually a good indicator that what they are saying may not be entirely true.
<ul>
<li>Ex: “man, come on…”; when saying this, the “a” in man is said in a higher pitch. </li> 
<li>This is more prevalent in men than women, due to the difference in their natural voice tones.</li></ul> 
</p>
<b>Rate of speech</b>
<p>Does the subject speak in a manner that differs from how they normally speak?
Do they suddenly slow their speech or speed it up?
<ul>
<li>A higher rate of speech can indicate nervousness. </li> 
<li>A slower rate of speech (or hesitations) can indicate the subject is trying to buy time to try and think of what they will say to a question. </li></ul>
</p>

<b>Choice of words</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Does the subject make themself a pronoun?</li>
<li>Do they take themself out of the situation?</li>
<li>Is there a change in adjective use (my kids → the kids, my car → the car).</li>
<ul>
<li>Subject will do these things to try and separate themselves from the crime.</li></ul> 
<li>Are they trying to convince you they are telling the truth?</li>
<li>Are they actually answering your questions? Do they repeat the question? </li>
<ul>
<li>By doing these, the subject is trying to buy time; stalling.</li></ul></ul></p> 

<b>Qualifying answers</b>
<p>Does the subject express some level of uncertainty about their answer’s own accuracy?
<ul> 
<li>Ex: “If I am understanding the question correctly, …” </li>
<li>Indicates “if I am not understanding the question correctly, then I am not able to answer it” </li></ul>
</p>

<b>“Rule of 3”</b>
<p>When a subject denys things 3 times, they are trying to convince you they are telling the truth.
<ul> 
<li>Ex: repeating “no no no no” to a simple accusation or question.</li></ul></p>

<b>Verbal/nonverbal disconnect </b>
<p><ul><li>Does the subject shake their head “no” while saying “yes”?</li>
<li>Does the subject shake their head “yes” while saying “no”?</li>
<li>That verbal to nonverbal disconnect in their behavior is a good indicator that the subject doesn’t truly believe in what they are telling you.</li></ul>

	<div class="block block-strong"><p>Microexpressions are flashes of true emotions that the face will display for a brief second without 
		    the liar knowing. The muscles in the face are one of the most complex areas on our bodies and 
		    some of them can't be controlled to hide genuine emotions. Though they aren't signs of lying, 
		    they can be an insight on someone's unmasked emotions. Signs of pressed lips, widened eyes, 
		    or raised eyebrows can be some examples of microexpressions. When someone is scared they can 
		    tend to raise and pull their eyebrows together, raise and tense their eyelids and pull their lips 
		    back. </p>
			<p>
			Microexpressions are the minute facial features a person exhibits automatically.
			<ul>
<li>Ex: raised eyebrows to surprise, lowered eyebrows to anger or disgust.</li></ul>
These are tricky to spot, so pay close attention to your subject’s face (but don’t get right up in their face and stare them down, that’d probably freak them out a little).
