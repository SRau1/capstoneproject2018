      <p>Lie To Me is a training application to improve cognitive functions and perceptive skills 
		to detect if someone is lying or not. Though this app does not provide a guaranteed answer, 
		the user's inputs are evaluated by an algorithm developed by our research and evaluations 
		from academic studies. Lie To Me provides quizzes that help users learn more in depth 
		to what each tell could mean and other varying factors that could influence the user's 
		results. This application is not meant to act as a crutch, but to train the user to 
        become a better lie detector themselves. </p>
