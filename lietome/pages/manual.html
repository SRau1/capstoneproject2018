	  <p>Before questioning your subject, set up a profile for them. Then the first thing you should do is perform a baseline questioning 
	  for your subject. This helps determine if they are lying during the actual questioning. How they act while they are not being 
	  questioned will most likely be how they will react normally. Start off by asking neutral questions such as: "how was your day?" or "did 
	  you enjoy your weekend?" Then when you proceed to actually question then, notice any changes in their behavior compared to how they 
	  acted when you asked the neutral questions. This can help determine if they are lying or not.*</p>
	  
	  <p><p>*Disclaimer: this application is made to be a training app to detect lying and the results are not a definite answer to if the 
		  person is lying or not. Our results are determined by an algorithm deduced by our research for what is important to look for when questioning a subject. </p></p>

  <div id="tab-1" class="page-content tab"> 
	<p>Avoiding eye contact can detect if someone is worried and their eyes will shift around the room. 
		This usually happens when someone is becoming too stressed and will naturally try to find 
		a way to find a solution to the situation. One also might tend to blink a lot when they are lying.</p>
	<p>However, there can be other factors to why someone is avoiding eye contact. They may 
		shift their eyes side to side when they think to gather their thoughts. Or they 
		may be uncomfortable or nervous because of the situation they are in or who is around them.</p>
	</div>
	  
    <div id="tab-2" class="page-content tab">
	<p>Body contact can tell a lot about a person, whether it be their posture, where they are 
	    facing, their breathing, or if they fidget a lot. Usually when someone is lying they 
	    tend to guard themselves by crossing their arms or legs, or place something in between 
	    themselves and the person asking the question. They could be knowingly or unknowingly facing 
	    the door as a sign that they want to get out of the situation. Other physiological tells 
	    like rapid breathing, redness of the face, or sweating can be signs of nervousness. One should also 
	    pay attention to any small signs of twitching or change in pupil size. </p>
	</div>
	  
    <div id="tab-3" class="page-content tab">
	<p>There are different voice patterns that can be detected when someone is lying like speech 
		hesitations, pitch, or rate of their speech. Speech hesitations consist of the use of 
		"uh", "um" or other variations of filler words. 
		Compared to one's regular voice, when a person is lying they can tend to change their voice 
	    	pitch either be higher or lower than normal. Another thing to take in consideration while 
		listening to someone answer is how fast someone is talking. People tend to talk slower, 
	    	when they are lying in order to buy more time for them to think of the best lies for their 
	    	story to be more believable.</p>
	</div>
    
	<div id="tab-4" class="page-content tab">
	<p>Microexpressions are flashes of true emotions that the face will display for a brief second without 
		    the liar knowing. The muscles in the face are one of the most complex areas on our bodies and 
		    some of them can't be controlled to hide genuine emotions. Though they aren't signs of lying, 
		    they can be an insight on someone's unmasked emotions. Signs of pressed lips, widened eyes, 
		    or raised eyebrows can be some examples of microexpressions. When someone is scared they can 
		    tend to raise and pull their eyebrows together, raise and tense their eyelids and pull their lips 
		    back. </p>

	<div id="tab-5" class="page-content tab">
	<p>Contrary to popular belief, people tend to fidget <i>less</i> when they are lying. People tend to fidget
			when they are nervous, but in deceptive situations it has an opposite effect. Watch out for signs
			 of someone trying to focus too much on hiding that the fact that they are lying. </p>
