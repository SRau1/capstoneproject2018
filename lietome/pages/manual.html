		<p>Avoiding eye contact can detect if someone is worried and their eyes will shift around the room. 
			This usually happens when someone is becoming too stressed and will naturally try to find 
			a way to find a solution to the situation. One also might tend to blink a lot 
	    when they are lying.</p>
	    <p>However, there can be other factors to why someone is avoiding eye contact. They may 
		    shift their eyes side to side when they think to gather their thoughts. Or they 
		    may be uncomfortable or nervous because of the situation they are in or who is around them.

	<p>Body contact can tell a lot about a person, whether it be their posture, where they are 
	    facing, their breathing, or if they fidget a lot. Usually when someone is lying they 
	    tend to guard themselves by crossing their arms or legs, or place something in between 
	    themselves and the person asking the question. They could be knowingly or unknowingly facing 
	    the door as a sign that they want to get out of the situation. Other physiological tells 
	    like rapid breathing or redness of the face can be a sign of nervousness. One should also 
	    pay attention to any small signs of twitching or change in pupil size. </p>

	<p>Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.
For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.
If it bleeds, we can kill it.</p>
