	<div class="block-title">How To Use This App</div>
	  <p>Before questioning your subject, set up a profile for them. Then the first thing you should do is perform a baseline questioning 
	  for your subject. This helps determine if they are lying during the actual questioning. How they act while they are not being 
	  questioned will most likely be how they will react normally. Start off by asking neutral questions such as: "how was your day?" or "did 
	  you enjoy your weekend?" Then when you proceed to actually question then, notice any changes in their behavior compared to how they 
	  acted when you asked the neutral questions. This can help determine if they are lying or not.*</p>
	  
	  <p>Using the slider, rate how much the person is showing their “tells” using the numbers 0, as not showing the tell at all, through 10, 
	  as strongly showing the tell. If you wish to not use the tell as a means to compare with the baseline test, you can opt out of the tell
	  by unchecking the tell. </p>
	  
	  <p><p>*Disclaimer: this application is made to be a training app to detect lying and the results are not a definite answer to if the 
		  person is lying or not. Our results are determined by an algorithm deduced by our research for what is important to look for when questioning a subject. </p></p>

	<div class="block-title">Tips</div>
	  <p>Look for subject’s personal ticks 
Understand and listen for what people actually say
Don’t just hear people, listen to them and understand what they say 
Be aware of body language 
Be aware of verbal language 
The more experience you get, the better you will be
There is no 1 trick to telling a lie
Build a rapport with the person
Find out things about the person: who are you, where are you from, etc. 
Ex: a car salesman does this when selling you a car 
When interviewing, some people remember things in different ways:
Sight oriented: use visuals, talk about “what did you see?”
Sound oriented: talk about “what did you hear?”
Feeling oriented: talk about “how did you feel during that”, “how did that make you feel”?
Is the person you are questioning rational or irrational (emotional or non-emotional) 
If emotional: family and status are important 
If non-emotional: facts, material possessions, etc. are more important than family/friends 
You have to know the person
Ultimately, if you are trying to question someone, you want the person to tell you their secret 
You wouldn’t tell your secret to a stranger
When questioning, get personal with them
Get closer to them (physically)
Use comfortable language to get their trust 
Mirroring: you mirror what the subject does 
There is no one tell that will mean a person is lying
There are several factors for a person doing a “tell”
Stomach acting up: they could be in a defensive physiological state OR they could have eaten bad food earlier 
Look for behavioral patterns 
The true way to tell if someone is lying will be a combination of things, not just one tell

  <div id="tab-2" class="page-content tab">
<div class="block-title">Eye Contact</div>  
	<p>Avoiding eye contact can detect if someone is worried and their eyes will shift around the room. 
		This usually happens when someone is becoming too stressed and will naturally try to find 
		a way to find a solution to the situation. One also might tend to blink a lot when they are lying.</p>
	<p>However, there can be other factors to why someone is avoiding eye contact. They may 
		shift their eyes side to side when they think to gather their thoughts. Or they 
		may be uncomfortable or nervous because of the situation they are in or who is around them.</p>
		<p>Does the subject avoid eye contact when answering questions?
Some say the eyes are the windows to the soul: if you believe this, then attempting to hide your eyes would be similar to “protecting” your soul from being looked at whenever you tell a lie 
Subjects who overly avoid eye contact are likely trying to hide something (or they are very nervous)
Things to look out for:
<p>Shifting eyes</p>
<p>Pupil size </p>

    <div id="tab-3" class="page-content tab">
	<div class="block-title">Physical Language</div>
	<p>Body language can tell a lot about a person, whether it be their posture, where they are 
	    facing, their breathing, or if they fidget a lot. Usually when someone is lying they 
	    tend to guard themselves by crossing their arms or legs, or place something in between 
	    themselves and the person asking the question. They could be knowingly or unknowingly facing 
	    the door as a sign that they want to get out of the situation. Other physiological tells 
	    like rapid breathing, redness of the face, or sweating can be signs of nervousness. One should also 
	    pay attention to any small signs of twitching or change in pupil size.
		</p>

		<div class="block block-strong">
<b>Posture</b>
<p>Is the subject slouched over? Crossing arms and/or legs?  
This is referred to as “closed” body language. 
People will do these things to try and “cover” themselves. They are protecting vital spots and trying to “hide” themselves, and the truth, from the person questioning them.</p>

<b>Breathing</b>
<p>In tense situations: is the subject’s breathing normal?
In calm situations: is the subject’s breathing heightened or irregular? 
Pay attention to your subject’s breathing pattern, as it can be a good way to determine their level of anxiety, nervousness, or lack thereof. </p>

<b> Fidgeting/Twitching</b>
<p>Is the subject playing with their hair, skin, fingers, etc.?  Do they seem uncomfortable?  Constantly moving (slight or large movements)?
When someone is nervous, they will tend to find some way to preoccupy their body, sometimes it’s a conscious effort (fidgeting), other times it isn’t (twitching).  These can also be referred to as “grooming gestures”.
Be sure to analyze your subject’s movement.</p>

<b>Sweating/Redness to the face</b>
<p>
Does your subject sweat when the room isn’t even hot?
Does your subject have an unnaturally red/flush face?
Both of these can reflect a rise in internal body temperature, which can reflect nervousness.</p>
 
<b>Physiological responses </b>
<p>When people are under stress or are nervous, there are some common physiological responses that their body exhibits:</p>
<p>- Dry mouth </p>
<p>- Sweating</p>
<p>- Gastrointestinal distress (farting, burping, stomach growling, etc.)</p>

<b>Alligator tears</b>
<p>This is basically “fake crying”; a person making the motions and sounds of crying, yet no actual tears are being shed. 
A rare sight to see, but if you do, it is a strong indication of lying. </p>

    <div id="tab-4" class="page-content tab">
	<div class="block-title">Verbal Language</div>
	<p>There are different voice patterns that can be detected when someone is lying like speech 
		hesitations, pitch, or rate of their speech. Speech hesitations consist of the use of 
		"uh", "um" or other variations of filler words. 
		Compared to one's regular voice, when a person is lying they can tend to change their voice 
	    	pitch either be higher or lower than normal. Another thing to take in consideration while 
		listening to someone answer is how fast someone is talking. People tend to talk slower, 
	    	when they are lying in order to buy more time for them to think of the best lies for their 
	    	story to be more believable.</p>
			<div class="block block-strong">
		<p>Voice pattern
Pay attention to the subject’s vocal pitch and tone
Does their voice fluctuate from how it normally sounds? 
This fluctuation is a good indicator for nervousness/anxiety/stress 
Random pitch change
When talking to someone, if their voice suddenly goes higher than normal when saying something, it is usually a good indicator that what they are saying may not be entirely true
Ex: “man, come on…”; when saying this, the “a” in man is said in a higher pitch 
This is more prevalent in men than women, due to the difference in their natural voice tones 
Rate of speech
Does the subject speak in a manner that differs from how they normally speak?
Do they suddenly slow their speech or speed it up?
A higher rate of speech can indicate nervousness 
A slower rate of speech (or hesitations) can indicate the subject is trying to buy time to try and think of what they will say to a question 
Choice of words
Does the subject make themself a pronoun?
Do they take themself out of the situation?
Is there a change in adjective use (my kids → the kids, my car → the car)
Subject will do these things to try and separate themselves from the crime 
Are they trying to convince you they are telling the truth?
Are they actually answering your questions? Do the repeat the question? 
By doing these, the subject is trying to buy time; stalling 
Qualifying answers 
Does the subject express some level of uncertainty about their answer’s own accuracy? 
Ex: “If I am understanding the question correctly, …” 
Indicates “if I am not understanding the question correctly, then I am not able to answer it”
“Rule of 3”
When a subject denys things 3 times, they are trying to convince you they are telling the truth 
Ex: repeating “no no no no” to a simple accusation or question 
Verbal/nonverbal disconnect 
Does the subject shake their head “no” while saying “yes”?
Does the subject shake their head “yes” while saying “no”?
That verbal to nonverbal disconnect in their behavior is a good indicator that the subject doesn’t truly believe in what they are telling you

	<div class="block-title">Microexpressions</div>
	<p>Microexpressions are flashes of true emotions that the face will display for a brief second without 
		    the liar knowing. The muscles in the face are one of the most complex areas on our bodies and 
		    some of them can't be controlled to hide genuine emotions. Though they aren't signs of lying, 
		    they can be an insight on someone's unmasked emotions. Signs of pressed lips, widened eyes, 
		    or raised eyebrows can be some examples of microexpressions. When someone is scared they can 
		    tend to raise and pull their eyebrows together, raise and tense their eyelids and pull their lips 
		    back. </p>
			<p>
			Microexpressions are the minute facial features a person exhibits automatically
Ex: raised eyebrows to surprise, lowered eyebrows to anger or disgust 
These are tricky to spot, so pay close attention to your subject’s face (but don’t get right up in their face and stare them down, that’d probably freak them out a little)
