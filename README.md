Senior Project for Undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
Project Premise: A mobile app that would train the user to spot the subtle physiological clues that most people exhibit when lying. The app would provide brief quizzes to test knowledge, and had a bare bones assistant feature to help jot down what physiological clues a person was exhibiting. From there, it would provide a basic probability calculation to determine if the person was lying.
